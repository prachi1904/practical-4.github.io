## Exercise #10: Internet Security Breach 
 
Browsers provide a rich set of features that enable interactive, compelling web applications.
Unfortunately, these features are also open to abuse. This project demonstrates how web sites
can spy on the user, steal sensitive information, and render the browser inoperable.
• Use the Firefox browser for this project, and for all projects in this class.
• you're pretending to be an attacker for this project, so your HTML files do not have to
pass validation.
• Unless noted otherwise, avoid the use of external scripts and stylesheets. Everything
should be included in the HTML file.
